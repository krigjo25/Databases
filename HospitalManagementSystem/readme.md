##  Summuary

* In the world of programming, there is always room for cleaning, 
the common choose were to devide the different methods in classes, 
and devide them into each python file, so there would be less mess 
in the code. Deviding lists, static and Dynamical tables, in different
files, to make the code more readable for others.


*  While designing the Database, the need for a better text reading 
software, than using plaint text were a need PDF were choosen as the
file format for the text files, the information from the database had
to be extracted to the PDF from the database, by using reportLab's Library,
 it could be achived. The way to store the information in the database,
could be a more challange as database only read bytes, not words, so by
using 'BLOB' the file could be saved in the database.

*  The experience by using  the foreign key, which where experienced,
to avoid the foreign key issue 150, there has to be only one Primary key,
but there can be multiply usage of the other keys suggested soulution is
to  Choose a different key for the foreignKey. The choice were to  use 
unique insted of Primary Key. For the row ID is the Primary targeting to 
retieve information.

*   Kriss had a slightly challange to merge all the floors into one table,
The thought were to create a new table, with foreign key, but it wouldnt work, 
as the assumption about foreign keys can not refer to more than one table the b
etter soloution were to create a view for this matter.

*   Since the database is growing, there would be a need for new databases to keep the records as easy to maintain as possible, A database for Archives, patientRegistrationsRegistration, and employeements
one database for employeements and stuff for the employeements, one for the administration, misc, and one for the patientRegistrationsRegistration
